HTML/PHP Workshop
========

####First steps!

Create a folder for the workshop.

Install composer. If you have installed globally just run `composer init` and `composer install` in the folder

####phpStorm considerations

In case you are using phpStorm, create a .gitignore to exclude the files autogenerated and also the vendor folder
```
/vendor/
/.idea/
```

The code for the example is done in php7, so if you are using phpStorm, you can go to 
preferences/Languages and Frameworks/PHP and select as PHP language level any above 7.

####The start

Create a sub-folder `public` where we are going to store the `index.php`, where we will write the code.

Run the PHP built-in server pointing the route where the index.php is included: 

```bash
php -S localhost:8085 -t public
```

Create script that returns `Hello Jorge` when passing the name through a GET request on a browser. 
Return the content of the GET request with an echo.
```
http://localhost:8085/index.php?name=Jorge
```
